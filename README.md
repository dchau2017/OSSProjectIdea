# Project Idea
The project would be a web/mobile app that connects other RPI students together if they want to share rideshares together (Uber/Lyft).
Users would log in using the RPI CAS system and would be able to browse other users and what date/time they are leaving/going to
RPI. If a time matches, users can chat and actually organize where they want to meet and then call the Uber/Lyft. The app
would not be responsible for calling the rideshare; it serves to just connect students together.

# Business Model
We would probably run ads on the site/mobile version to generate ad revenue. We could have a fremium model where we would have a 
free/paid version. In the paid version, users can schedule rides further out and have a schedule rides.
